Unit Test Creation
------------------
The FUSE emulator contains a large unit test suite of over 1,300 tests,
which cover both documented and undocumented opcodes:
   http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/ 

The tests are delivered in two files: a tests.in file that contains test 
inputs and a tests.expected that gives the expected output state for the 
Z80 processor. 

This project loads them from disk and creates standard .NET unit tests out
of the results. 

Because the FUSE emulator is GPL2 licensed, and this project is more
permissively licensed (under the MIT license), the test suite and resultant
.NET unit tests are excluded from the GitHub project, but they can be 
recreated by:

1. Download the FUSE emulator and extract the files 
      z80\tests\tests.* 
   to a convenient location.
   
2. Execute the command utility CreateUnitTests.exe, having adjusted the 
   location of the test files and output as appropriate

3. Copy the resultant fusetests.cs to the EmulatorTests folder and add it
   to that project.
